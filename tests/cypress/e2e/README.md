# Test Folder Structure & Conflict Prevention

Each member has their own directory under `cypress/e2e/`. To prevent merge conflicts in shared files, please follow these rules:

## 1. Member-Specific Steps
Add steps specific to your features in your own `steps/` folder:
- Path: `cypress/e2e/21XXXXX/steps/21XXXXX_steps.js`

## 2. Common Steps
Only add steps to `cypress/support/step_definitions/common_*` if they are strictly reusable across ALL members' tests.

## 3. Features
Keep your `.feature` files within your identifier folder:
- `cypress/e2e/21XXXXX/api.feature`
- `cypress/e2e/21XXXXX/ui.feature`
